# Salesforce Connector

The Salesforce [Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI620/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to work with records in Salesforce, a web-based service that allows organizations to manage contact relationship management (CRM) data. You can use the Salesforce connector to create, query, retrieve, update, and delete records in your organization's Salesforce data. The connector uses the [Salesforce SOAP API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_quickstart_intro.htm) to interact with Salesforce.

## Getting started
To get started with the connector, go to [Configuring Salesforce Operations](config.md). Once you have completed your configurations, you can perform various operations with the connector.

## Additional information

1. Download the connector from [WSO2 Store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/esbconnector/details/fbb433b5-4d74-4064-84c2-e4b23c531aa2) by clicking the Download Connector button.

2. Then you can follow this [Documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI640/Working+with+Connectors+via+the+Management+Console) to add and enable the connector via the Management Console in your EI instance.

3. For more information on using connectors and their operations in your EI configurations, see [Using a Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI640/Using+a+Connector).
